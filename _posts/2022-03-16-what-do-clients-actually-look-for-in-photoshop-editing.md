title: What do clients actually look for in Photoshop editing?
---

If you are a photographer outsourcing your editing:
Saving time or looking for better quality. Most of the time it’s a combination of the two.

When you start looking for someone to outsource your photo editing you are too busy to handle the retouching yourself, or, your in-house team has reached full capacity.
Or, you want to achieve a special effect that you don’t know how to do well enough.
If you are a private person having done a portrait session:
You want to look as good as you can in the images. Skin tones natural and true to your skin colour. Overall good colour and contrast as well as any pre-arranged requests.
If you are an advertising agency:
You want someone to follow and carry out the brief given and re-work until the image has been signed off/approved.
Different clients will have very specific requests, but they all expect the best possible quality within the pre-agreed price/fee.
